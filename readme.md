# Timestripe Native (Unofficial)

A native Android application inspired by [Timestripe](https://timestripe.com), focused on offline access and daily usability.

## Features

- Offline mode for accessing goals without an internet connection
- Home screen widgets for quick goal management
- Built with Jetpack Compose and native Android components
- Designed as a minimal, responsive foundation for further development

## Project Status

This is an early version with core functionality implemented.  
More features like timelines, reviews, and full sync are planned.

## Installation

Clone the project and build it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kerimabdy/timestripe-native.git
cd timestripe-native
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Motivation
As a Timestripe user, I wanted a faster, more flexible native experience on Android â€” especially with offline support and widgets.
